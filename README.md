Adding a section containing Q-Review results
-
This plug-in installs a new option to the "Course administration" menu: "Create Q-Review topic".
<br>(Please note: It will only be shown if a Q-Review is not already present for the course)

Once confirmed this option will do this:
 - create a new topic with the name "Q-Review" (which may be changed later)
 - add the Q-Review ressource to that topic
 - finally grab the returned Q-Review results and display them in an iframe as part of the topic summary
 
 You may treat the resulting topic like any other topic of that course.
